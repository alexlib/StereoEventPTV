#### Testing code:

Just download and run main.m. To generate the same figure with the paper, you need postprocess with paraview. A matlab code 'plotFlow3d' is contained in the utils [plot3d](https://github.com/vccimaging/RainbowPIV/tree/master/RainbowPIV/tools). 

#### Data:

Dataset is now available at [dataset](http://hdl.handle.net/10754/664999) or [dataset](https://doi.org/10.25781/KAUST-MSG02).

The time slot is divided based on the less blur of the accumulated image. And for our case, the vortex is usually 0.004-0.006, the injection is 0.01.
